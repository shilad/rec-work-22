## RecWork 2022: Workshop on Recommender Systems for the Future of Work 

The RecWork workshop seeks to **identify a forward looking research agenda for recommender systems research for work environments** in areas such as calendaring, productivity, community building, space planning, workforce development, and information routing.  

RecWork will bring together experts to engage in discussions around key challenges and open questions in the field. The workshop conversations will be captured through a **white paper outlining an agenda for recommender systems for the workplace** that will outline a forward-looking research agenda and serve as the foundation for future RecWork workshops.

All participants will be asked to share a short (one page) position paper or extended abstract (three page) describing a topic of interest for workshop attendees prior to attending the workshop. 

*Important Dates*
- Open question submissions deadline: September 4th, 2022.
- Open questions submissions shared with participants: September 9, 2022.
- Workshop date / time:Friday, September 23, 2022, 2pm to 5:30pm.

### Areas

* **Workplace personal assistants** deliver nudges that improve worker productivity.
* **Calendar applications** suggest meeting slots for better time management.
* Systems that suggest the best **space configurations** for hybrid work.
* Agents that **route questions** from information workers to experts in their organization.
* **Contact management, communication systems, and activity feeds** in products such as Microsoft Teams, Slack,
Meta Workplace, and Google Apps that are designed to positively shape internal relationships and community
building.
* **Training and workforce development systems** that understand the knowledge needed for individual growth and
opportunities to deliver it,
* **Personalized information dissemination** that seeks to improve individual and organizational knowledge and behavior.
* **Information seeking tools**, such as those in the financial sector, that provide domain-specific real-time contextual
information retrieval.
* **Intelligent matchmaking** both within and across organizations. Contexts include finding collaborators, experts, contractors, etc.

### Participatory Workshop Structure

RecWork will be structured as an **interactive format that strives to create opportunities for learning, dialog, and the
articulation of a forward-looking agenda for recommender systems in the workplace**.
This interactive structure in the workshopâ€™s first year will lay the groundwork for a more traditional RecWork
workshop in future years that includes a papers track.

RecWork will be a **half-day workshop that will include 20-50 participants**. The interactive format will focus on 
articulating a clear vision for opportunities for recommender systems research in the workplace. 

1) **Registration / Idea submission.** Before registering, participants will submit a short position paper (maximum one page) or an extended abstract (maximum three pages) sharing background information on them and the key questions in the field. These papers will be shared on the RecWork website for all participants to read prior to attending the conference. See submission process, below, for more information.

2) **Lightning thoughts.** Participants will deliver a one-slide, two-minute lightening talk at the beginning of the workshop.

3) **Breakout discussion sessions.**  All participants will contribute to a small breakout discussion centered around an area of interest to them. Organizers will identify breakout areas based on themes from the submitted papers. The goal of each session will be to detail historical, current, and (especially) future recommender systems research within one area. Each session will include a designated scribe whose role will include recording discussion notes that can be included in the final whitepaper.

4) **Closing plenary.** A short closing summarizing insights and outlining next steps for this work stream.

5) **Post-workshop whitepaper.** After the workshop, organizers and interested participants will work to distill themes and insights into a whitepaper outlining a forward-looking agenda for recommender systems in the workplace. This will be used during future RecWork iterations that could take a more conventional paper-driven program.  


### How to Participate

RecWork strives to foster vibrant conversation from engaged stakeholders. To achieve this, every participant is asked to submit a short position paper or extended abstract (see submission process, below).

### Paper Submission

Every attendee will be asked to share either a position paper (maximum one page) or an extended abstract (maximum three pages) sharing background on them and one (or more) critical questions for recommender systems in the workplace. These papers are intended to be lightweight for authors and will serve to catalyze and shape discussion. 

Attendees should submit the papers via email to recwork22@gmail.com. Organizers will lightly review these submissions and responded quickly with feedback and information about workshop participation. All papers will be published on the workshop website with links sent to attendees to read before the workshop.

Structure for position papers:
* One page maximum, format is open 
* A short discussion related to Recommender Systems in the workplace. This could describe one of the following:
  * A key open question related to Recommender Systems in the Workplace
  * An area of research outside of the traditional RecSys field that is connected to Recommender Systems in the Workplace
  * Published or unpublished workthat you have conducted as a practitioner or scholar in the area.
  * Anything else you think is of interest to attendees!
* Your biography

Structure for extended abstracts:
* Maximum four pages
* Same elements as position paper, but with more extended scientific background or possible initial findings
