### Overview

The goal of the RecWork workshop is closing the gap in recommender systems research for work environments in areas such as calendaring, productivity, community building, space planning, workforce development, and information routing. RecWork will bring together experts who will collaboratively synthesize a forward-looking research agenda for recommender systems in the workplace. The outcome will be captured through a white paper that will serve as the foundation for future RecWork workshops. These steps will help advance research in workplace recommenders and broaden the reach of the RecSys conference.

### Areas

* Workplace personal assistants deliver nudges that improve worker productivity.
* Calendar applications suggest meeting slots for better time management.
* Systems that suggest the best space configurations for hybrid work.
* Agents that route questions from information workers to experts in their organization.
* Contact management, communication systems, and activity feeds in products such as Microsoft Teams, Slack,
Meta Workplace, and Google Apps that are designed to positively shape internal relationships and community
building.
* Training and workforce development systems that understand the knowledge needed for individual growth and
opportunities to deliver it.
* Information seeking tools, such as those in the financial sector, that provide domain-specific real-time contextual
information retrieval.

### Program

RecWork will be structured in an interactive format that strives to create opportunities for learning, dialog, and the
articulation of a forward-looking agenda for recommender systems in the workplace.
This interactive structure in the workshopâ€™s first year will lay the groundwork for a more traditional RecWork
workshop in future years that includes a papers track. RecWork will ultimately expand the breadth and impact of the
main RecSys technical program for the workplace.

RecWork will be a half-day workshop that will include 20-50 participants. We anticipate the format to be interactive,
with a goal of articulating a clear vision for opportunities for recommender systems research in the workplace. The
workshop structure provides space for dialog and distillation in key emerging and established recommender systems
areas for the workplace. While the format for the workshop is likely to change based on feedback from registrants, we
anticipate the following elements:

* Opening introduction. A short opening introduction sharing the structure and goal of the workshop.
* Lightning questions. Every participant will be asked to prepare a single slide and one to two minute description
of a key open question for recommender systems in the workplace. This session will give us an understanding of
the breadth of interests and opportunities for the field.
* Moderated panel. Given that this is the first workshop of this series, we aim to invite research leaders from
both academia and industry to an interactive panel discussion that explores the history, current trends, and
future opportunities for recommender systems in the workplace.
* Breakout discussion sessions. We will assemble small breakout sessions centered around interests articulated
by panelists and attendees. The goal of each session will be to detail historical, current, and (especially) future
recommender systems research within one area. Each session will include a designated scribe whose role will
include recording discussion notes that can be included in the final whitepaper.
* Closing plenary. A short closing summarizing insights and outlining next steps for this work stream.
Following RecWork, we will kick off a working group between organizers and interested attendees to distill themes
and insights from sessions into a white paper that will be disseminated within the RecSys community. We will ensure
that audio recordings and detailed notes are kept during all sessions throughout the workshop to serve as a starting
point for this white paper
