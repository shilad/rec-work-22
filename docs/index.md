### Overview

As organizations increasingly digitize their business processes, the role of recommender systems in work environments is expanding. The goal of the RecWork workshop is closing the gap in recommender systems research for work environments in areas such as calendaring, productivity, community building, space planning, workforce development, and information routing. RecWork will bring together experts who will collaboratively synthesize a forward-looking research agenda for recommender systems in the workplace. The outcome will be captured through a white paper that will serve as the foundation for future RecWork workshops. These steps will help advance research in workplace recommenders and broaden the reach of the RecSys conference.
